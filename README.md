# PHP-Discord-Chat-App-Twilio

This application was created as the final for my PHP course.

It utilizes discord Oauth login functionality to allow a user to login into the chatApp.
Unless you want to create an account manually; if you forget your password the Twilio account would send you a text message to reset your password
(although the account may no longer be active by the time you read this).

Assuming you have the chatApp running on Port 9000 you will be able to login to the ChatApp try with 2 broswers open; and you can see it working!
